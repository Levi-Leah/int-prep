Infrastructure:: everything needed to deplpoy your software into a cloud env

- *compute*
* VMs
* containers (clusters, registers)
* serverless (functions, API gateways)

- *foundation*
* security (IAM, KMS)
* networking (VPC, subnets, firewalls, load balancers)
* APM (monitoring, logging, alerting)

- *data*
* MQ (queues, pub/sub)
* databases (SQL, NoSQL)
* object stores

- *applications*
* images
* container images
* code packaging
* CI/CD

SaaS:: allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet. Provides a complete software solution that u purchase on pay as you go basis from cloud service provider (google email, salesforce CRM, google office tools).

---

IaaS:: part of SaaS. IaaS is a cloud computing service where companies rent servers for compute/storage in the cloud. alloes users run OSs or apps on servers w/o maintenance/operating costs for the servers.

---

IaC:: using code to manage IaaS.

[NOTE]
====
- Automating infra is important cause apps could be deployed to prod up to 100 times a day. YOu don't wanna do that manually.

- It's also important to provision/deprovision in response to load.

Qs::
- how do we get images for VMs?
- how do we get container images in?
- how do we package up and ship code into serverless functions?

---

historic view::
- 1st wave: static infra, e.g. some VMs u access via ssh
- 2d wave: more containers + provisioning tools to specify app behaviors; w/ docker and datadog
- 3d wave: uses containers, serverless, and managed services as part of app

[NOTE]
====
- modern infra may look more complex but is easier to maintain
- grey squares are the code you own, which is way less than previously
- operational burden has been decreased

ways to manage resources::
- manual (e.g., through console)
- ad-hoc automation (e.g., cli commands/scripts to create and mod resources. You're usinhg some code but you can't really scale. It's not easy to reuse and mod.)
- IaC
* provisioning: declaratively creating and modifying resources
* configuration:changing the state of an existing resource post provisioning

---

ways to write IaC::
- JSON
- DSL
* domain specific language
* specific to the tool/cloud provider
- common programming language
* e.g., type script, .NET, java script, go
* allows you to do things that's aren't possible or not easily achieved w/ other methods, e.g. for loops, conditionals, classes, etc.
* allows you to use common IDEs, linters, frameworks
